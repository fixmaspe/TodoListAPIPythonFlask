# `03.2` Check for Live URL

It looks like your API is running live! 

You can check it out by clicking on the URL (that was displayed on the command line) once Flask started running like this:

![Check Flask Live](../../assets/live-api.gif?raw=true)

Once you open it successfully, your live API should say `Not Found` like this:

![Not found API](../../assets/not-found.png?raw=true)

The reason the API says `Not found` right now is because we have not added any endpoints so far.  Now we have to start adding endpoints!
