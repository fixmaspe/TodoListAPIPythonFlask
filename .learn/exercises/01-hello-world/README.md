# Hello World with Flask 

During this tutorial, we'll be building a REST API using Python programming language and the [Flask library](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) (ideal for creating APIs).

But we are going to do it the right way! Following all the good practices, we have to install and learn some things first.

## 📦 Requirements

1. Python 3+

2. Pipenv: we are going to be using the [Pipenv package manager](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) during these exercises, please install [Pipenv in your computer](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation) if you don't have it already.

If you are building this project using Gitpod, you don't have to install anything. Pipenv and Python 3 already come pre-installed.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Open a new terminal (leave this one open)

2. Make sure you have python version 3:

```bash
$ python --version

# alternatively you can type

$ python3 --version
```


👉 Note: if you don't have python version 3 you should go ahead and install it, we [🔥 strongy recommend using Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install python.

3. Make sure you have pipenv installed:

Instead of using Pip and virtual env, we are going to be using Pipenv: A combination of both technologies that will make your life much easier.

```bash
$ pipenv --version
```
